1,easy,"The sun is warm, and the sky is clear. Birds sing as they fly from one tree to another. A small breeze moves the leaves gently. People walk on the path, smiling as they enjoy the day. This passage is simple, but it helps you build steady typing speed."
2,medium,"Typing requires both focus and rhythm, much like playing an instrument. Each key you press creates a pattern that forms words and sentences. Mistakes are natural, but the real challenge lies in correcting them without breaking your flow. With enough practice, speed and accuracy come together in harmony."
3,hard,"Beneath the shimmering canopy of stars, a solitary traveler reflected on the paradox of progress. Technology had accelerated communication, yet patience seemed increasingly rare. Mastery of typing mirrored this duality, demanding both swiftness and meticulous precision. Each keystroke became a reminder that efficiency without accuracy was ultimately meaningless."
